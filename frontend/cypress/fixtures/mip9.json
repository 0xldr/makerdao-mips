      "\n\n",
      "## Paragraph Summary\n\n",
      "This proposal aims to standardize the process for allowing MKR Token Holders to inform the Domain Teams of their preferences for collateral types that have been proposed through [MIP6](mips/details/MIP6 \"smart-Mip\"). The preferences of the MKR Token holders are expressed in the form of an on-chain governance poll. The governance polls (Community Greenlight polls) are published at the start of the first and third weeks of the governance cycle and will run for a period of two weeks.",

      "## Motivation\n\n",
      "While domain teams are free to choose their own workload, an on-chain governance poll provides the Domain Teams key insights into the community's sentiment for each collateral type that has been proposed. In addition to this, it is important to gather the opinion of MKR Token Holders towards the proposed collateral asset before the full domain work takes place. This helps prevent work from being wasted on undesirable collateral types.",
      "\n\n",
      "## Specification / Proposal Details\n\n",
      "### MIP9c1: The Community Greenlight Process\n\n",
      "- For an asset to be onboarded to the Maker Protocol, it must pass an executive vote as part of [MIP12](mips/details/MIP12 \"smart-Mip\"). Community greenlight is the process through which early sentiment is measured and used to direct the work of domain teams towards assets that MKR Holders will be willing to onboard after work has been completed.\n- The community greenlight process for a potential collateral asset consists of an on-chain governance poll using the template defined in [MIP9c4](mips/details/MIP9#MIP9c4 \"smart-Component\").\n- The community greenlight polls occur at fixed times each governance cycle, starting on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month and running for a period of 2 full weeks.\n- A potential collateral asset is valid for a community greenlight poll if it has a [MIP6](mips/details/MIP6 \"smart-Mip\") Application that has been published on the official forum for a period of 2 weeks prior to the start date of the greenlight poll.\n\n",

This list should include collateral types that have been both greenlit and deferred.\n- At the Governance Facilitators’ discretion, community greenlight polls may be deferred to a later date.\n- At the Governance Facilitator’s discretion, community greenlight polls may be deferred to a later date.\n- If the Governance Facilitators opt to defer community greenlight polls, a reason must be communicated to the community via the official forum before the greenlight poll was scheduled to take place.\n\n",
