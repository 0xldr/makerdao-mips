      "## Motivation\n\n",
      "This proposal aims to layout one part of the generalized process for adding collateral types to the Maker Protocol. This generalized process will allow the community to get an idea of what the applying collateral is, an overview of the risks, and an understanding of the potential benefits to Maker. A consistent application form allows prospective collateral types to be easily compared by the community. The pitch materials enable the interested party to generate interest from the Maker community.",
      "\n\n",
      "Although this is only one component of the overall collateral onboarding process, this proposed standard would decrease confusion surrounding how to start the process of getting collateral added to the Maker Protocol and, ultimately, increase the onboarding speed at which new collateral types can be onboarded.",

      "1.  Fill out the application/questions in as much detail as you're willing.\n\n    -   Once filled out, the application must be published on the official MakerDAO forum and should be posted within the `Collateral Onboarding Applications ([MIP6](mips/details/MIP6 \"smart-Mip\"))` subcategory within the `Collateral Onboarding` category.\n    -   This post should have the tag `collateral-app.`\n    -   Note that an 'interested party' refers to anybody willing to act as a stakeholder for this onboarding process.\n\n2.  After the submission on the forum, the community will likely have follow up questions. While not a requirement, answering questions about your project may help generate support or excitement for the proposed collateral type. Additionally, the interested party may organize an optional call to pitch their proposal as well as open up further discussion to the community.\n\n3. Once the [MIP6](mips/details/MIP6 \"smart-Mip\") application has been published for at least two full weeks, it is eligible for a Community Greenlight poll defined in [MIP9](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md).\n\n",
