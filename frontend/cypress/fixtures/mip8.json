      "## Paragraph Summary\n\n",
      "This proposal defines the process where at least one domain team from each domain (Risk, Smart Contracts, Oracles, Legal, etc.) \"Greenlights\" the collateral type (based on research) in order for the collateral onboarding process to proceed.",

      "### MIP8c1: Domain Greenlight Process\n\n",
      "- For an asset to be onboarded to the Maker Protocol, domain work must be completed by risk, oracle, smart contracts, and optionally legal domain teams. Domain greenlight is the process through which domain teams signal their willingness to complete domain work on a proposed collateral asset.\n- The domain greenlight process occurs after a proposed collateral asset has passed a [MIP9](mips/details/MIP9 \"smart-Mip\") Community Greenlight Poll.\n- If any domain team signals unwillingness to work on a proposed collateral asset, it does not mean that the asset will never be included as collateral in the Maker Protocol.\n- If at least one domain team from the risk, oracle, and smart contracts domains do not greenlight a proposed collateral asset, the onboarding process for that asset awaits alternative domain teams willing to perform the domain work.\n\n",

      "- Communication from domain teams regarding domain greenlight must come within two weeks of the end of the [MIP9](mips/details/MIP9 \"smart-Mip\") Community Greenlight poll on the official forum.\n- A domain team should aim to signal their greenlight outcome within two weeks of the end of the [MIP9](mips/details/MIP9 \"smart-Mip\") Community Greenlight poll.\n- If a domain team cannot signal their greenlight outcome, they must do the following before the target date passes:\n    - Post a reason for the delay on the official forum.\n    - Post a new target date for communicating their domain greenlight outcome on the official forum.\n- If subsequent dates will be missed, communication should be provided before the deadline passes, and should include a new target date.\n- If further information becomes available that changes the domain team's assessment, they can modify their greenlight outcome by posting on the official forum at any time.\n- If a deferred outcome is given, resumption criteria must be provided on the official forum.\n- If resumption criteria from a deferred outcome are met, the greenlight outcome should be modified to greenlit.\n\n",
