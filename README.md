# makerdao-mips
This project is a MIPs Tracker for MakerDAO Improvement Proposals. 

## Dependencies
Requires git to be installed and that it can be called using the command git.

## Api search
In the search field, specify a string of words that the text operator parses and uses to query the text index. The text operator treats most punctuation in the string as delimiters, except a hyphen-minus (-) that negates term or an escaped double quotes \" that specifies a phrase.

## Creating a personal access token (GIT_ACCESS_API_TOKEN)

You should create a personal access token to use in place of a password with the command line or with the API. Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to when using the [GitHub API](/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#via-oauth-and-personal-access-tokens) or the [command line](#using-a-token-on-the-command-line). 

### Creating a token
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

7. Click **Generate token**.

8. Click to copy the token to your clipboard. For security reasons, after you navigate off the page, you will not be able to see the token again.

   **Warning:** Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your programs.

## Webhooks documentation
Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server. You're only limited by your imagination.
